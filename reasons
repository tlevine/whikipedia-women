I asked Mako on this 
http://suegardner.org/2011/02/19/nine-reasons-why-women-dont-edit-wikipedia-in-their-own-words/

1)

* Studies on college students
  * Internet skills, &c.
* Aaron Shaw
* Ester Hargetai
* Information, Communication, Society

2) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because they are too busy.

* Doesn't know of much
* Mako has some on competition between wikis
* Haiyi Zhu

3) Some women don’t edit Wikipedia because they aren’t sufficiently self-confident, and editing Wikipedia requires a lot of self-confidence.

* There's a theory from social psychology about women and self-confidence
* Doesn't know of any research related to Wikipedia

4)

* There's some work on conflict in Wikipedia
* Collier & Bear
  * Conflict, Criticism, or Confidence
